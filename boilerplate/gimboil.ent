<!ENTITY ginfowp.cpcdata '<title>CORROSION PREVENTION AND CONTROL (CPC)</title>
<para>Corrosion prevention and control of Army materiel is a continuing concern. It is important that any corrosion problems with this item be reported so that the problem can be corrected and improvements can be made to prevent the problem in future items. The term corrosion means the deterioration of a material or its properties due to a reaction of that material with its chemical environment. An example is the rusting of iron.</para>
<para>Corrosion damage in metals can be seen, depending on the metal, as tarnishing, pitting, fogging, surface residue, and/or cracking. Plastics, composites, and rubbers can also degrade (also considered to be corrosion based on the above definition of corrosion). Degradation is caused by thermal (heat), oxidation (oxygen), solvation (solvents), or photolytic (light, typically ultraviolet) processes. </para>
<para>The most common exposures are excessive heat or light. Damage from these processes will appear as cracking, softening, swelling, and/or breaking. The US Army has defined the following nine (9) forms of corrosion used to evaluate the deterioration of metals. These shall be used when evaluating and documenting corrosion.
<randlist bullet="no"><item>UNIFORM (or general attack): Affects a large area of exposed metal surface, like rust on
steel or tarnish on silver. It gradually reduces the thickness of the metal until it fails.</item>
<item>CREVICE: Occurs in crevices created by rubber seals, gaskets, bolt heads, lap joints, dirt
or other surface deposits. It will develop anywhere moisture or other corrosive agents are
trapped and unable to drain or evaporate.</item>
<item>SELECTIVE LEACHING: One element, usually the anodic element of an alloy,
corrodes away, leaving the cathodic element. This can create holes in metal.</item>
<item>INTERGRANULAR: Metal deterioration caused by corrosion on the bonds between or
across the grain boundaries of the metal. The metal will appear to be peeling off in
sheets, flaking, or being pushed apart by layers. A particular type of intergranular
corrosion is exfoliation.</item>
<item>PITTING: This can result from conditions similar to those for crevice corrosion. Pits
can develop on various materials due to their composition. Rifle boxes are big victims of
pitting.</item>
<item>EROSION: Results when a moving fluid (liquid or gas) flows across a metal surface,
particularly when solid particles are present in the fluid. Corrosion actually occurs on the
surface of the metal, but the moving fluid washes away the corrosion and exposes a new
metal surface, which also corrodes.</item>
<item>FRETTING: Occurs as a result of small, repetitive movements (e.g., vibration) between
two surfaces in contact with each other. Itâ€™s usually identified by a black powder
corrosion product or pits on the surface.</item>
<item>GALVANIC: Occurs when two different types of metal come in contact with each other,
like steel bolts on aluminum, for example. This is a common problem on aircraft because
of their mix of metals.</item>
<item>STRESS: Term used to describe corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue.
Where an item is not ready/available due to one of these forms of corrosion, it shall be
recorded as a corrosion failure in the inspection record and the appropriate code (170) for
corrosion shall be used when requesting/performing maintenance.</item>
