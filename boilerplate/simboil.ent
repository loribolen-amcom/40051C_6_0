					<title>The Army Maintenance System MAC</title>
					<para>This introduction provides a general explanation of the maintenance classes/levels, functions, and other information contained in the MAC.</para>
					<para>The MAC (immediately following this introduction) designates overall authority and responsibility for the performance of all maintenance
tasks on the identified end item or component. The application of the maintenance tasks to the end item or component shall be consistent
with the capacities and capabilities of the designated maintenance levels, which are shown in the MAC in column (4). Column (4) is divided
into two secondary columns. These columns indicate the maintenance levels of &apos;Field&apos; and &apos;Sustainment&apos;. Each maintenance level column is further divided into two sub-columns. These sub-columns identify the maintenance classes and areas follows:
<seqlist>
							<item>Field level maintenance classes:
							<seqlist>
									<item>Crew (operator) maintenance. This is the responsibility of a using organization
to perform maintenance on its assigned equipment. It normally consists of inspecting, servicing, lubricating, adjusting, and replacing parts,
minor assemblies, and subassemblies. Items with a "C" ("O" for joint service reporting) in the third position of the SMR code may be replaced
at the crew level. A code of "C" ("O" for joint service) in the fourth position of the SMR code indicates complete repair is authorized at
the crew level. </item>
									<item>Maintainer maintenance. This is maintenance accomplished on
a component, accessory, assembly, subassembly, plug-in unit, or other portion by field level units. This maintenance is performed either
on the system or after it is removed. An "F" in the third position of the SMR code indicates replacement of assemblies, subassemblies,
or other components is authorized at this level. An "F" in the fourth position of the SMR code indicates complete repair of the identified
item is allowed at the Maintainer level. Items repaired at this level are normally returned to the user after maintenance is performed.</item>
								</seqlist>
							</item>
							<item>Sustainment level maintenance classes:<seqlist>
									<item>Below depot sustainment. This is maintenance accomplished on
a component, accessory, assembly, subassembly, plug-in unit, or other
portion either on the system or after it is removed. The item subject
to maintenance has normally been forwarded to a maintenance facility
away from the field level supporting units. An "H" in the third position
of the SMR code indicates replacement of assemblies, subassemblies,
or other components is authorized at this level. An "H" appearing
in the fourth position of the SMR code indicates complete repair is
possible at this level. Items are normally returned to the supply
system after maintenance is performed at this level.</item>
									<item>Depot. This is maintenance accomplished on a component, accessory,
assembly, subassembly, plug-in unit, or other portion either on the
system or after it is removed. Assets to be repaired at this level
are normally returned to an Army Depot or authorized contractor facility.
The replace function for this level of maintenance is indicated by
the letter "D" or "K" appearing in the third position of the SMR code.
A "D" or "K" appearing in the fourth position of the SMR code indicates
complete repair is possible at the depot sustainment maintenance level.
Items are returned to the supply system after maintenance is performed
at this level.</item>
