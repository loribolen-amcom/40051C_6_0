required on each individual component piece of a wood packaging product. On dunnage, the marking shall be applied every 2 feet to opposite surfaces of each piece. If possible, the mark shall be visible when the dunnage is placed in the load to enable inspectors to verify the WPM&apos;s compliance without unloading or unstuffing the container.
