<title>GENERAL</title>
<para>In addition to the Introduction work package, this RPSTL is divided into the following work packages.
<seqlist>
<item>Repair Parts List Work Packages. Work packages containing lists of spare and repair parts authorized for use in the performance
of maintenance at the levels determined by the MAC/SMR code. These work packages also include parts which must be removed for replacement
of the authorized parts. Parts lists are composed of functional groups in ascending alphanumeric sequence, with the parts in each group listed
in ascending figure and item number sequence. Sending units, brackets, filters, and bolts are listed with the component they mount on. Bulk
materials are listed by item name in the Bulk Items work package which follows (select the work package the bulk items follow: the last Parts
List work package, the Special Tools Repair Parts work package, or Kits) work package. (choose one of the following) Repair parts kits
are listed separately in their own functional group and work package OR Repair parts kits are listed at the end of the individual work
packages. Repair parts for reparable special tools are also listed in a separate work package. Items listed are shown on the associated
illustrations."</item>
<item>(Include the text in items 2 through 4 and 6 only if the described work package is included in the TM.) Special Tools Repair Parts Work
Package. This work package lists any spare parts required for the special tools, TMDE, or other support equipment listed in the Special
Tools Work Package that are not listed in any other publication. </item>
<item>Kits work package.  This work package lists all repair kits and their component parts.</item>
<item>Bulk Items Work Package.  This work package lists all items identified as &apos;bulk&apos; in the parts lists. Due to the nature of bulk items, this work package does not include a figure.</item>
<item>Special Tools List Work Packages. This work package lists those special tools, special TMDE, and special support equipment authorized
by this RPSTL (as indicated by Basis of Issue (BOI) information in the DESCRIPTION AND USABLE ON CODE (UOC) column (6)). Tools that are components of common tool sets and/or Class VII are not listed.</item>
<item>Cross-Reference Indexes Work Packages. There are (enter applicable number) cross-reference indexes work packages in this RPSTL. The National Stock Number (NSN) Index work package refers you to the Figure and item number for each NSN listed in the RPSTL. The Part Number Index work package refers you to the Figure and item number for each part number listed in the RPSTL.

<para>This RPSTL lists the authorized spares and repair parts; special tools; special test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE); and other special support equipment required for performance of (enter maintenance level) maintenance of the (enter item name). It authorizes the requisitioning, issue, and disposition of spares, repair parts, and special tools as indicated by the source, maintenance, and recoverability (SMR) codes. </para>

<title>GENERAL</title>
<para>In addition to the Introduction work package, this RPSTL is divided into the following work packages. <seqlist>
<item>Repair Parts List Work Packages. Work packages containing lists of spare and repair parts authorized for use in the performance of maintenance at the levels determined by the MAC/SMR code. These work packages also include parts which must be removed for replacement of the authorized parts. Parts lists are composed of functional groups in ascending alphanumeric sequence, with the parts in each group listed in ascending figure and item number sequence. Sending units, brackets, filters, and bolts are listed with the component they mount on. Bulk materials are listed by item name in the Bulk Items work package which follows (select the work package the bulk items follow: the last Parts List work package, the Special Tools Repair Parts work package, or Kits) work package. (choose one of the following) "Repair parts kits are listed separately in their own functional group and work package OR Repair parts kits are listed at the end of the individual work packages. Repair parts for reparable special tools are also listed in a separate work package. Items listed are shown on the associated illustrations."</item>
<item>(Include the text in items 2 through 4 only if the described work package is included in the TM.) "Special Tools Repair Parts Work Package. This work package lists any spare parts required for the special tools, TMDE, or other support equipment listed in the Special Tools Work Package that are not listed in any other publication.</item>
<item>Kits work package. This work package lists all repair kits and their component parts.</item>
<item>Bulk Items Work Package. This work package lists all items identified as &apos;bulk&apos; in the parts lists. Due to the nature of bulk items, this work package does not include a figure.</item>
<item>Special Tools List Work Packages. This work package lists those special tools, special TMDE, and special support equipment authorized by this RPSTL (as indicated by Basis of Issue (BOI) information in the DESCRIPTION AND USABLE ON CODE (UOC) column). Tools that are components of common tool sets and/or Class VII are not listed.</item>
<item>Cross-Reference Indexes Work Packages. There are (enter applicable number) cross-reference indexes work packages in this RPSTL: the National Stock Number (NSN) Index work package and or, the Part Number (P/N) Index work package (If reference designator is used enter:, and the Reference Designator Index work package). The National Stock Number Index work package refers you to the figure and item number for each NSN listed in the RPSTL. The Part Number Index work package refers you to the figure and item number for each part number listed in the RPSTL." (If reference designator is used enter: "The Reference Designator Index work package refers you to the figure and item number of each reference designator listed in the RPSTL).

<para>Index Numbers. Items which have the word BULK in the figure column will have an index number shown in the item number column. This index number is a cross reference between the NSN/Part Number (P/N) Index work packages and the bulk material list in the bulk items work package. For a combined narrative RPSTL manual associated publications shall not be included. </para>

<seqlist>
<item>When NSNs or Part Numbers Are Not Known. First. Using the table of contents, determine the assembly group to which the item belongs. This is necessary since figures are prepared for assembly groups and subassembly groups, and lists are divided into the same groups. Second. Find the figure covering the functional group or the subfunctional group to which the item belongs. Third. Identify the item on the figure and note the number(s). Fourth. Look in the repair parts list work packages for the figure and item numbers. The NSNs and part numbers are on the same line as the associated item numbers.</item>
<item>When NSN Is Known. 
<randlist><item>
First. If you have the NSN, look in the STOCK NUMBER column of the NSN index work package. The NSN is arranged in NIIN sequence. Note the figure and item number next to the NSN. </item><item>Second. Turn to the figure and locate the item number. Verify that the item is the one for which you are looking for.</item></randlist></item>
<item>When P/N Is Known. <randlist>
<item>First. If you have the part number and not the NSN, look in the PART NUMBER column of the part number index work package. Identify the figure and item number.</item> 
<item>Second. Look up the item on the figure in the applicable repair parts list work package." Include item 4 only if the RPSTL has a reference designator index work package.</item>

<item>When Reference Designator Is Known. 
<randlist>
<item>First. If you know the reference designator, look in the REFERENCE DESIGNATOR column of the reference designator index work package. Note the figure and item number. </item>
